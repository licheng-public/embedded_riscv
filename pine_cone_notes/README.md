# Hack notes on Pinecone

Here collects the scattered notes that I took when playing BL602 dev-kit from pine64.
The SDK code can be found at [bl_iot_sdk](https://github.com/pine64/bl_iot_sdk).

1. [How to rebuild bootloader from the tree](build.md)?

2. [How to enable uart logs for boot](uart_log.md)?

3. How to flash LED using GPIO?

4. How to read temperatures/humid/pressure from BME 280?
