Although new programmming languages like RUST begin to gain some tractions in embedded system,
C programming language still dominates. The classic [C
textbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language),
authored by Brian and Dennis, is the bible for embedded software engineers.

C programmming language is a big topic. It has many concepts including control flow
(if/else/while/for), functions, array, pointer, structure, and the rich set of C libararies.
However, we focus on the several specific areas that are associated with hardware closely.
